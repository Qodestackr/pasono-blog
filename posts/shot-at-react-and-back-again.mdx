I began writing code year 2020. Though struggled with consistency, I did learn a thing or two about JavaScript. My journey in tech has been far from easy. 

A framework like React is meant to offer:
- Better productivity/ developer experience and tooling
- Seamless development of scalable dynamic applications
- Crafting better UIs with ease. Better in the sense of reusability, interoperability, accessibility ..etc

But also:
- Frustrations of having to change my mindset to that of the framework

With React, it was love at first sight. I was amazed by its one way data flow which made issues with data synchronization and performance refreshing. Building components with functional code while still being just a library was like a cherry on top.

### The Hero on Forms
<!-- Show how forms are handled in JS/ Vanilla -->
<!-- Show why React sucks -->
<!-- Show how Svelte does it.. -->

Forms are hard to get right in Vanilla JavaScript. In React, they are even harder. We have to first choose between controlled & uncontrolled inputs. Why do I have to make a choice in the first place??

The recommended way is controlled forms. But its too verbose.

Building a huge form is hard. For this reason, I have to choose a third-party library:


Its hard to make a robust solution with readable code



### Context

<!-- Performance pitfalls -->

<!-- Split it -->

<!-- Build a Compose HOC -->

### Forward Refs

### useEffect
